The giant sable antelope lives in forests near water, where leaves and tree sprouts are always juicy and abundant. It is a critically endangered subspecies; it is protected in natural parks and hunting it is forbidden. Typically, giant sable antelopes are specialized browsers feeding on foliage and herbs, especially those growing on termite mounds. One of the reasons for the decline in giant sable antelope numbers could be the animals' very specific feeding patterns. Typically, they will feed on tree leaves, which make up to 90% of their diets, at heights of 40–140 mm (1.6–5.5 in) from the ground, taking only the leaves.

Relationship with humans
The giant sable antelope is a national symbol of Angola and is portrayed on numerous stamps, banknotes, and even passports of the nation.[5] The Angola national football team is fondly known as the Palancas Negras in honor of this antelope.
