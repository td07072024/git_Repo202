The giant sable antelope (Hippotragus niger variani), also known in Portuguese as the palanca negra gigante, is a large, rare subspecies of the sable antelope native and endemic to the central highlands of Angola, occurring specifically in two areas: Cangandala National Park (south of the city of Malanje) and Luando Natural Strict Reserve (between the Kwanza and Luando Rivers, south of Cangandala).

It was first described in 1916 by Frank Varian, a British engineer and naturalist, as a new subspecies of sable antelope distinguished by its size, horn structure and length, and unique facial markings. At the time, Varian worked on the construction of Angola’s Benguela Railway, which connected the inland mining areas with the Atlantic coast. His work in the remote highlands brought him into contact with some of the country’s unique wildlife, leading to his discovery of the giant sable, which he subsequently documented and brought to scientific attention. The giant sable was the last of the large antelopes to be discovered, with its discovery occurring after that of the Okapi.
