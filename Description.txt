Both sexes have horns, which for the male can reach 65 inches (1.65 meters in length). Males and females are very similar in appearance until they reach three years of age, when the males become darker and develop majestic horns. The males weigh an average of 238 kg (525 lb) with a height of 116–142 cm (46–56 in). Females weigh 220 kg and are slightly shorter than males. The horns are massive and more curved in males, reaching lengths of 81–165 cm (32–65 in), while females' horns are only 61–102 cm (24–40 in) in length. Coloration in bulls is black, while cows and calves are chestnut, except in southern populations where females turn brownish-black. Most sable antelopes have white "eyebrows", their rostra are sectioned into cheek stripes, and their bellies and rump patches are white. Young under two months old typically are light brown and have slight markings.

The largest giant sable antelope horns recorded to date measured 65 inches long. The animal was shot by the Count of Yebes in Angola in 1949 and became the world record.
